# C++ FACTORY PATTERN FIRST ORDER ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

This is simple example application of C++ factory pattern in numerical solution first order ordinary differential equation. You can try this by compiling with

```
g++ -I./concrete -I./factory -I./interface */*.cpp client.cpp -o numerical
```
